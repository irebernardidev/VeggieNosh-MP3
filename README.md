# Design
The architect behind VeggieNosh aimed for a seamless fusion of user-friendliness and modern design principles. This vegan online cookbook is a testament to their commitment to providing an accessible, visually appealing platform where recipes are not only shared but showcased with elegance and clarity.
The following design elements were used in the website:

- ## Technical Framework
The [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) front-end framework, inspired by Material Design, was the choice for VeggieNosh, bringing a fresh, responsive feel to the table. Together with [JQuery](https://jquery.com/), it lays down the interactive groundwork that makes the navigation and presentation of recipes intuitive and fluid.

- ## Colour Scheme
VeggieNosh embraces a color scheme that draws eyes to the vibrant dishes. A backdrop of white space ensures that the rich colors of the food images pop, complemented by touches of green that echo the essence of fresh, vegan ingredients. The addition of coral energizes and directs users through calls to action, creating an inviting, dynamic experience without overwhelming the visual senses.

Core colors:
- coral (#ff4242): Selected for its lively and inviting quality, encouraging user interaction.
- lightblack (#2e2e2e): Ensures text is readable against the light background.
- mediumwhite (#fffafa) and white (#ffffff): Provide a clean and contemporary canvas for the content.
For account settings, a trio of colors was selected to intuitively guide users through their options:

- Red: For actions that require caution or are irreversible.
- Yellow: For moments where caution is advised or to signal a change.
- Green: For positive actions, confirming correct selections or completion.


## Colour Palette

- ## Typography

â€¢ The choice of Open Sans as the primary font is deliberate, offering readability and a contemporary ambience, while Ubuntu lends a distinct personality to headings and buttons, enhancing the overall design language.

- ## Imagery
VeggieNosh website primarily relies on a text-based interface to create a distraction-free quiz environment. However, some key images and icons are used:
  * Logo: 

  * Icons: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons are used to visually communicate functions like social media links and volume control. They are displayed in the website's primary color for consistency.

  * [Favicon](https://www.favicon.cc/): A unique favicon is provided that is representative of the brand identity. It's visible in the browser tab for easy site identification.

## Wireframes
Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). Please note some improvements were made during the development of the website.

# Features
## Existing Features

The website is comprised of a home page, a games page, a leaderboard page, a contact form page a 404 error page & a 500 error page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:
- A [favicon](https://www.favicon.cc/) in the browser tab.
![Favicon](documentation/features/browser-favicon.png)

- The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.
![Ttle](documentation/features/title.png)

- Social Media Icons:
Appearing on every page, the icons are appropriate representations of the Social Media platforms, linking users to the various platforms. The icons appear in the centre of the footer.

### The Home Page

![Home Page](documentation/features/home-page.png)





### The 404 Error Page
The 404 error page displays the sites name as a title. This also acts as a link back to the home page. Within the page there is a sorry message explaining to the user that there has been an error directing them to the page they were looking for. The user can click on Home button or title to redirect themselves to the home page.

### The 500 Error Page
The 500 error page displays the sites names as a title, which also acts as a link back to the home page. Within the page is an error message that tells the user sorry there seems to be an internal server error. The user can click on Home button or title to redirect themselves to the home page.

## Features to Implement in the future
- Additional features that could be added to the website in the future include:
   * 
## Accessibility
Throughout coding this site I kept accessibility in mind, to ensure that the website is user friendly for any user. I did this by:

  * Using semantic HTML.
  * Using descriptive aria labels for all links.
  * Providing information for screen readers when using icons - such as footer icons.
