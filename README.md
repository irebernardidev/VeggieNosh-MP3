# VeggieNosh: Vegan Recipe-Sharing Web Application

Dedicated to the vibrant world of vegan cuisine, VeggieNosh is a contemporary recipe-sharing platform drawing inspiration from esteemed sites like [The Vegan Society](https://www.vegansociety.com/) and [Rainbow Plant Life](https://rainbowplantlife.com/). It provides users with a user-friendly interface to craft, share, and archive their cherished vegan recipes.

> **Note**: This endeavor is an integral component of the Code Instituteâ€™s Milestone Project 3, as part of their Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. It proficiently demonstrates the implementation of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Flask, MongoDB, and other technologies, meeting the essential criteria for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations.
