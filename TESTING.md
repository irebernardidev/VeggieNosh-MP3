Throughout the entire development process, I extensively used Chrome Developer Tools for real-time testing and troubleshooting. I leveraged its console feature to ensure JavaScript code functionality and identify any issues.

To verify adaptability, I employed Google Chrome Developer Tools and Firefox's Inspector tool to check the responsiveness of each page across various devices and screen sizes. This rigorous approach ensured a seamless user experience on multiple platforms.

### AUTOMATED TESTING
#### W3C Validator
[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate the CSS.

[jshint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate the JavaScript.
- [script.js](documentation/testing/validation/jshint.png) - No errors or warnings.

------
#### Python Validator

To ensure that my code adheres to PEP8 guidelines, I am utilizing the [pycodestyle package](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) within my (IDE).

- [run.py](documentation/testing/validation/run_pep8_validator.png) - No errors or warnings.

#### Lighthouse

I employed the [Lighthouse](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?pli=1) feature in Chrome Developer Tools to evaluate the website's performance, accessibility, adherence to best practices, and SEO. While the resulting scores were good for most pages, some were not quite at the level I had hoped for. Enhancing these aspects will be a key focus in my upcoming implementation efforts, as I aim to elevate the overall quality and user experience of the website.

| Search for recipes easily. | Upon selecting the "All Recipes" page, I am presented with an array of recipe cards, neatly arranged in rows with 8 recipes per page. Each card showcases the recipe's image, name, and a brief description. When I select a specific recipe card, I am seamlessly taken to a dedicated page for that recipe, which offers comprehensive details about the ingredients, preparation steps, and other relevant information.                                       | [All Recipes](documentation/readme/all_recipes.png)|
| Explore all site recipes. | At the top of the homepage, just above the display of recipe cards, there's a prominent "Explore Veggie Creations" button. A click on this button navigates to the "All Recipes" page, which offers a full view of the available recipes. On this page, there is also a search bar that enables users to enter specific search terms. This search feature is robust, capable of returning results from complete words or even from a mere few letters of a word, ensuring that users can easily find the recipes they're interested in. | [Explore Veggie Creations ](documentation/testing/explore_rec.png)[Search veggie recipes](documentation/testing/explore_rec2.png)|
| View complete recipes of interest.      | Selecting a recipe card allows any user, regardless of registration or login status, to access the complete details of the recipe.                                 | [Recipe Card](documentation/testing/card.png) [Recipe Card Info](documentation/testing/card2.png)|
| Intuitive navigation with clear Sign-Up.      | Navigation for guests who have not registered is facilitated by the availability of several links on the Navbar, specifically: Home, Browse Dishes, Enter The Kitchen, and Join VeggieNosh. Upon arriving at the landing page, new visitors will immediately notice the Join VeggieNosh and Login buttons, conveniently positioned at the upper right corner of the screen for easy access.                                     | [Navbar](documentation/testing/nav.png)|

| 1  | "Delete" and "Edit" button text missing on small devices (320px).                                      | Implemented a media query to restore button text visibility on small devices.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2  | Similar visibility issue with "Change username" and "Change password" buttons.                         | Increased the space between buttons by removing the "buttons-container" class, enhancing button visibility.                                                                                                                                               |
| 3  | "Add Veggie Recipe" button not prominent, previously only in the navbar dropdown.                             | Added "Add New Recipe" button on the "My Recipes" page above recipe cards and included icons in the navbar dropdown for better visibility and user guidance.                                                                                               |
| 4  | Issues with password and username functionality; users could create multiple accounts with minor variations in username case. | Fixed by introducing a regex validator to standardize username input, preventing the creation of multiple accounts due to case sensitivity differences.                                                                                                     |                                                                     |
| 5  | Overlapping elements in the recipe form page, specifically the "Recipe category", "Dish type", and "Diet type" dropdowns.  | Resolved by overriding some Materialize CSS styles and adjusting the layout of the containers to eliminate overlap and improve form usability.                                                                                                             |
#### Known Bugs
In the console, a warning appears stating, 'Error with Permissions-Policy header: Unrecognized feature: 'interest cohort.'' This warning is due to a new header implemented by GitHub, aimed at enhancing user privacy on GitHub pages by disabling the 'interest-cohort' feature. Despite this, some browsers like Chrome may not recognize the 'interest-cohort', leading to the warning. It's important to note that this is merely a warning and does not impact functionality.
